Marketing Mix Modelling for a Retailer

The dataset has different data for a year of retailer journey including:
- Sales Transactions
- All channels Investment
- NPS Score
- Product List
- Discounts
- Special Discounts and Holidays

For the purpose of the project, we focused on the Media investment channels and how they influence Total GMV. 

We have implemented a Regression model to predict the future behavior of variables based on their past, by constructing a regression equation that considers proportion of investments in different marketing channels, to maximize Total Revenue.
